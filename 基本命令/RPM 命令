首先安装rpm-build 包

[root@centosx ~]# yum install rpm-build

接下来我们用 安装apache 的rpm 来熟悉RPM 命令 ：
rpm -Uvh /home/user/httpd-2.4.52/*.rpm
Replace -Uvh with -ivh if you are doing a fresh install, in my cases I am doing an upgrade from old apache server.



Below are the list of options info for your reference:

i - install (This installs a new package)
v - verbose (using or expressed in more words than are needed)
h - hash (Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is unpacked)
U - upgrade (This upgrades or installs the package currently installed to a newer version. This is the same as install, except all other version(s) of the package are removed after the new package is installed)
